A trance-heavy mix, focused on otherwordly textures, brimming with arpeggiated adrenaline throughout. I released this ahead of my set at Intima in Philadelphia, where I played alongside Copenhagen trance titans Ida Engelhardt and Ezy and New York City's Lydo, head of the X-TRA SERVICES party series.
